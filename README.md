Donkey Kong
===================================

Classic Donkey Kong game, created using LabVIEW.

This was done to demonstrate my proficiency in LabVIEW after a week-long training during the first week of my internship at National Instruments, summer 2015.

## Gameplay
As Mario, you are to jump up the floors to rescue Princess Peach from Donkey Kong. But beware! Goombas are scattered along the way. One touch, and you die.

## Setup
If you have LabVIEW, you can see all the VI's created for the game. Beware, it's a jumbled mess of virtual wires. Otherwise, you may run the .exe file on Windows. Make sure that the images included are in the same directory as the .exe when running.

To be able to run the game, you must first install the [LabVIEW Runtime Engine 2014](http://www.ni.com/download/labview-run-time-engine-2014/4889/en/).
